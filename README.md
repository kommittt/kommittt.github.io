my cool and epic and awesoe site or somethign woag
so cool right
by the way hi aster and possibly also hyphen

anyways uh

i made this so i have somewhere to put my shit onto without worrying about limits and have ultimate customisability at the cost of server-dependent functions such as sending messages or images
i'll figure it out though, there might be a way

also html is lowkey cool?? pretty simple too, not that bad and soul sucking unlike wordpress (dear god)

updates whenever i want to
mostly for splash texts but sometimes i update UB:SA (ultrabox sample archive, its tiring to type it all out) as well

# what to expect here:
i have no reason to put this other than waste time and yap (i am very good at doing both)
- about me and other stuff like where to find me in other sites
- my projects such as music (heavy wip) and links to my friday night funkin things
- ultrabox sample archive
- silly buttons
- easter eggs...?
- shitload of splash texts
- and potentially more fun stuff coming soon!!

thats all really

someone end my suffering i am so tired
