my site woag
figured id make my own little corner in the internet because what better way to express yourself than to make your own little space
i think, at least

i made this so i have somewhere to put my shit onto without worrying about limits (fuck you carrd) and have ultimate customisability at the cost of my braincells and dynamic website stuff (aka the really cool shit, i still want strawpages drawing thing </3)

also html is lowkey cool?? pretty simple too, not that soul sucking unlike wordpress (dear god)

updates whenever i want to(TM)
mostly for splash texts but sometimes i update UB:SA (ultrabox sample archive, its tiring to type it all out) as well

# what you will find here:
- hundreds of splash texts!
- splat.mp3
- ultrabox sample site i made for my friend but turned out to be useful for some other people too!(tm)
- basically anything revolving around me :sob:
- super cool stuff i find epic so now its in the site in a not-so hidden way (yay)
- my crushed hopes and dreams
- totally not code i permanently borrowed from reddit and stackoverflow and we3schools
- secrets...?

# what you may expect in the future:
- my music stuff!
- live updating feed for my socials
- commission stuff i guess? i tend to see that a lot in artist sites
- actual proper sitemap
- bring back archived pages (dear god not the fanfiction)
- sitemap that shows every non secret page available
- artchive reworked maybe (dont count on it.)
- anything i find cool that is within my ability to make (which is incredibly rare!!)

thats all really

someone end my suffering i am so tired
