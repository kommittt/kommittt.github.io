my cool and epic and awesoe site or somethign woag
so cool right
by the way hi aster and possibly also hyphen

anyways uh

i made this so i have somewhere to put my shit onto without worrying about limits (fuck you carrd) and have ultimate customisability at the cost of my braincells and dynamic website stuff (aka the really cool shit, i still want strawpages drawing thing </3)

also html is lowkey cool?? pretty simple too, not that soul sucking unlike wordpress (dear god)

updates whenever i want to(TM)
mostly for splash texts but sometimes i update UB:SA (ultrabox sample archive, its tiring to type it all out) as well

# what to expect here:
i have no reason to put this other than waste time and yap (i am very good at doing both)
- about me and other stuff like where to find me in other sites
- my projects such as music (heavy wip) and links to my friday night funkin things
- ultrabox sample archive
- silly buttons
- easter eggs...?
- shitload of splash texts
- and potentially more fun stuff coming soon!!
