              <p>Moon and Kommit, two contrasting souls, find themselves confined to an attic that becomes both their prison and refuge. Through playful teasing, quiet moments, and shared vulnerabilities, their initial tension softens into a deep, unspoken bond.
                <br>As their connection grows, the attic transforms from a place of isolation into something resembling home, where their walls come down and something new begins to bloom.

    <ul class="associations">
      <li>Recently updated (April 14, 2025) to have more emotions and make it seem more... human. Despite me being an android, a furry, or an old TV.
        Depends on who you're askin', really. Would much rather prefer the first option, though.
        <br>
        <br>Anyways, lotsa things have changed. The general over-arching plot of the stories have stayed mostly the same however, albeit some modifications to make the
        characters more "like themselves", plus some consistency and less repeats.
        <br>Oh, and a LOT less Kommit blushing. Like, c'mon, I'm not that blushy! Literally every story pre-edit ends with my cheeks being red...
        <br>
        <br>TL;DR - Major rewrite, with the help of a whale. Oh, and dark mode! Enable it, it's near the top of the page.

    <p>
      Moon slouched against the attic wall, his lanky frame draped in a loose purple hoodie that swallowed his hands,
      the fabric shimmering faintly under the dim light. His hair — dyed a deep violet — fell in messy waves, as the crescent moon pendant he always wore shimmered in the attic's dusty sunlight.
    </p>

    <p>
      Across the room, Kommit sat cross-legged on the floor, quietly scribbling in a notebook. His black turtleneck clung to his slender frame,
      sleeves rolled up to reveal pale arms dotted with doodles of stars and tiny crescent moons.
    </p>

    <p>
      “You’re still drawing me?” Moon smirked, nodding at the notebook. “Pathetic.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Kommit snapped the book shut, his eyes glancing up at Moon's. “I-I’m not!” His voice cracked.
      “I was just— sketchin' other shit. Characters. Random faces. Whatever.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Moon leaned in, accompanied with a smirk forming at his lips. “Uh-huh. Sure.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “Besides,” Kommit huffed, “why the hell are you so interested, huh?”
    </p>

    <p>
      “I'm just curious…” Moon slowly walked over, towering over him by a full 10 centimeters.
      Suddenly, Moon’s hand darts out, snagging the sketchbook before Kommit can react.
    </p>

    <p>
      “Wh- Hey!”
    </p>

    <p>
      He flips through the pages with the reckless speed of someone who already knows what he’ll find — personified objects, an absurd amount of night lamps,
      half-finished landscapes, weird furry robots and shadowed faces blurring past — until his fingers freeze.
      There, glaring back at him in smudged graphite: his own lazy grin, his hoodie strings tangled from Kommit’s obsessive cross-hatching, his stupid,
      sleep-softened face captured a dozen times over like Kommit was trying to memorize the angles.
    </p>

    <p>
      Moon’s fingers stilled on the page. For a heartbeat — two — the attic held its breath. Kommit’s pencil rolled off the floorboards, the clatter too loud. <br>
      Then Moon’s mouth curled, slow and inevitable, like a sunrise he’d been waiting to ruin.
      “Damn, bro.” He whistled, tapping the sketch of his own sleep-mussed hair, smudged from Kommit erasing too hard. “You’re <i>obsessed</i> obsessed.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “It’s— s-shut up!” Kommit spluttered, yanking the sketchbook back and clutching it to his chest like a shield. He hardened his grip, 
      afraid Moon would lunge for it again, half afraid he’d see too much. He ducked his head, jaw set in a pout, and glared at the floor instead of Moon’s smirk.
      “It’s practice, arright?”
    </p>

    <p>
      “Uh-huh.” Moon dropped beside him, their knees bumping. “Damn,” he whistled, poking the sketchbook’s spine.
      “You’re holding that thing like it’s your firstborn.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “Anatomy studies!” Kommit huffed. “Total coincidence it’s all your dumb face!”
    </p>

    <p>
      Moon’s grin widened. “Sure, sure. And I totally believe you accidentally drew me five times—”
    </p>

    <p>
      “You’re a nightmare.” Kommit kicked his shin. “Why did I decide to draw you again?”
    </p>

    <p>
      “Because I’m art,” Moon sighed, flopping backward onto the floor like a martyred saint. “A muse.”
      He rolled onto his side, propping himself up on one elbow, head resting lazily on his palm. “A vision—”
    </p>

    <p>
      “A menace,” Kommit muttered.
    </p>

    <p>
      “Just admit it.” Moon’s voice dropped to a purr, “You think I’m pretty.”
    </p>

    <p>
    Kommit playfully shoved him away, but his lips formed a bright smile. “Pfft. You wish.”
    </p>

    <p> <br>-<br><br> </p>

    <p>
    The attic was their prison and their sanctuary. Moon had been dumped here first — a “disciplinary measure” after one too many fights at school.
    Kommit arrived weeks later, hauled up by his dad, who declared the dusty room a fitting place for a “boy who lives in his head.”
    </p>

    <p>
    They’d circled each other like feral cats at first. Moon, all sharp edges and louder-than-life bravado; Kommit, quiet and coiled,
    hiding behind sarcasm and sketchpads. But nights in the attic were long, and loneliness had a way of sanding down walls.
    </p>

    <p>
      One unusually cold evening, Moon caught Kommit shivering under his blanket, phone glow painting his jawline blue.
      Without a word, Moon peeled off his hoodie—still warm from his body—and tossed it at Kommit’s lap. “Put this on. You look like you’re gonna freeze to death.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Kommit’s breath fogged between them as he shuddered. “Nah, I’m alright.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Moon rolled his eyes. “Well, too bad.” He crossed the room in three strides, planted himself on Kommit’s bedside,
      and pressed the hoodie firmly against his chest. “You’re wearing it.”
    </p>

    <p>
    “N-No, I don't need it—”
    </p>

    <p>
    “I'm not leaving until you do it.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Kommit froze. Then, with the reluctance of a cat being shoved into a sweater, he tugged the hoodie on. It drowned him — sleeves swallowing his hands,
      hem brushing his thighs. Moon’s scent (caffeine and synthetic lavender, because of course he used bargain-bin laundry soap) clung to the fabric.
    </p>

    <p>
      “…Happy?” Kommit muttered, voice muffled.
    </p>

    <p>
      Moon hummed, lips quirking. “Cute.” He retreated to his desk, the click of his laptop keyboard filling the silence.
    </p>

    <p>
      Kommit stopped shivering. He occasionally glanced up from his phone to track Moon’s movements — unaware that Moon’s peripheral vision caught every
      flick of his eyes.
    </p>

    <p>
      “Since you no longer look like you’re about to get hypothermia,” Moon said, still glued to his screen, “you planning on giving me back the hoodie? Orrrr…?”
    </p>

    <p>
      Kommit startled. “Of course I will, dumbass.”
      He yanked the hoodie’s strings tight, as if that could hide how he’d nuzzled into it. “Don’t wanna smell like I drank eight liters of coffee anyway.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Moon chuckled. The keyboard clicks resumed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hours later, Moon finally saved his project and stretched. His gaze landed on Kommit — curled up like a cat, peacefully asleep, one sleeve pressed to his nose.
    </p>

    <p>
      Moon hesitated. <i>‘I’ll just ask for it when he’s awake,’</i> he decided, biting back a smile.
    </p>

    <p> <br>-<br><br> </p>

    <p>
    Kommit’s denials were art forms.
    </p>

    <p>
    “You’d look good in skirts,” Moon said one night, rummagging and flipping through Kommit’s closet — a parade of baggy jeans and oversized hoodies. <br>
    He flung aside a hoodie, then another, and sighed. “Like, c’mon.” He held up a faded blue shirt, wrinkling his nose.
    “Spice up your closet a bit. Give it some…” He waved a hand, “Color. Variation. Whatever you artsy types call it.”
    </p>

    <p>
      A beat. Then Moon’s eyes lit up.
    </p>

    <p>
      “Oh shit! Imagine you in, like, a pink skirt.” He jabbed a finger at Kommit’s horrified face. “Not baby pink. pastel pink. The kind that screams <i>femmy</i>.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Kommit’s soul exited the stratosphere. “Dude, what?? The hell makes you think I'd like skir- I am not a femboy!!!” Kommit stuttered and slurred his words together,
      frantically trying to defend his integrity against Moon's crude comments.
    </p>

    <p>
    “Never said you were.” Moon leaves Kommit's closet alone, then holds up a choker with a tiny silver moon he grabbed from his desk. “But this’d kill on you.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Kommit glared, arms crossed like a petulant cat. He refuses to say a single word, hoping it would make Moon feel even just the slightest tinge of shame.
    </p>

    <p>
    “No?” Moon’s grin widened. “What a shame.” He sighed, faux-tragic, before digging into his pocket — something jingled.
    </p>

    <p>
      Kommit’s ears perked up. Then flattened against his skull as realization hit.
    </p>

    <p>
      “Ahhh, maybe this is more your type~” Moon cooed, shaking the bell-adorned collar like he was summoning a very disgruntled house pet.
      The ding-ding-ding echoed between them, obscene in its cheerfulness.
    </p>

    <p>
      Kommit’s soul briefly left his body. “Did you really have to stoop this low?” he whispered, voice hollow.
    </p>

    <p>
      “Of course I do, shortie.” Moon snorted, barely containing his laughter as Kommit visibly crumpled, groaning into his hands.
      “C’mon, it even matches your vibe! Jingly. Annoying. Cute as he—”
    </p>

    <p>
      “I will bite you.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “Promises, promises.”
    </p>

    <p> <br>-<br><br> </p>

    <p>
    Storms cracked the sky open one July night. A bright flash followed by thunder rattled the attic window. Kommit slowly woke,
    his sleep interrupted by the raging tempest outside. Slowly opening his eyes, he noticed Moon is still awake, his eyes glued out the window.
    </p>

    <p>
    “…Are you okay? Can’t sleep?” Kommit mumbled, face filled with concern.
    </p>

    <p>
    ...
    </p>
    
    <p>
    He slowly sits up, alerted by Moon's unusual silence. No jokes, no bravado,
    just the thud of rain battering the roof, shriek of wind clawing at the window, and the hollow whistle slipping through the cracks.
    </p>

    <p>
    Moon’s laugh sounded frayed. “Nah. Just… hate storms.”
    </p>

    <p>
    Kommit stared. Moon, the same person who teased him relentlessly, who spat curses like poetry… kept awake over a thunderstorm?
    </p>

    <p>
    Without thinking, he crawled over and wrapped his arms around Moon’s waist.
    </p>

    <p>
    Moon stiffened. “What’re you—”
    </p>

    <p>
    “Shut up.” Kommit pressed his face to Moon’s back. “I'm only doin' this because you're… warm.”
    </p>

    <p>
    Moments pass, then Moon’s hands covered his, grip tight. “…Thanks.” 
    </p>

    <p>
    The two spent a few minutes hugging each other in silence, the ambiance filled only by the pattering of rain with the occasional distant thunder. <br>
    After a few minutes, Moon’s thumb brushed slow circles over Kommit’s knuckles, his shoulders loosening like he’d shed an invisible weight.
    He nudged back slightly, a silent ‘I’m good’, and Kommit’s arms reluctantly slackened.
    </p>

    <p>
      Moon twisted to face him. “Wow,” he whispered, grin creeping in. “Never took you for a cuddler.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Kommit exhaled, long-suffering. “Bro. I comfort you, and this is the thanks I get?” He pouted, sighing for effect. “Also, It was a, uh… a tactical hug. For warmth.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “Mhmmm…” Moon’s eyes glittered with mischief. “And the hand-holding? Also tactical?”
    </p>

    <p>
      “I will push you out this window.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Moon laughed, bright and easy, the storm now just background noise. “Admit it. You’ve got a soft spot.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Kommit scowled. “You’re insufferable, I swear.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “Yours, though,” Moon hummed, poking his cheek.
    </p>

    <p>
      Kommit smiled, content that Moon is now back to his usual self.
    </p>

    <p>
      Moon stretched out, limbs loose like the storm had wrung all the tension out of him. 
      Kommit lingered upright for a bit longer, just long enough to watch Moon’s breathing even out. <i>'Asleep. Finally.'</i>
      Exchanging one last glance to the sleeping figure, he reluctantly makes his way to his bed on the other side of the room.
    </p>

    <p>
      Kommit laid down and stared at the ceiling, replaying it all — Moon’s rare honesty, the way he’d clung to Kommit’s hands like an anchor.
      He rolled over, shoving his face into his pillow like it could smother the memory, the embarassment finally catching up to him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then, a rustle. In a slight panic, Kommit jolted up and turned his head towards his roommate.
      He squinted his eyes, trying and failing to see if Moon was secretly laughing at him.
      Unable to see properly in the 3 AM darkness, he quietly made his way to Moon's bed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Moon was out cold, mouth slightly open, one arm flung over his face like even in sleep, he was dodging the spotlight.
      He reached over, hesitated, then flicked the snoring Moon’s wrist — no reaction. A sigh of relief.
    </p>

    <p>
      He went back to his bead and flopped back down, arm slung over his eyes, counting the seconds as raindrops tap on the roof just to avoid thinking about a certain someone.
    </p>

    <p>
      …One last glance. Moon hadn’t moved.
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>Victory.</i>
    </p>

    <p>
      Kommit let himself smile, just for a second, before rolling over. “...G'night, idiot,” he muttered into the dark.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside, the rain gentled to a whisper.
    </p>

    <p> <br>-<br><br> </p>

    <p>
    The game started innocently.
    </p>

    <p>
    “Truth or dare,” Moon drawled, spinning a bottle between them.
    </p>

    <p>
    Kommit rolled his eyes. “Childish.”
    </p>

    <p>
    “Truth: Why do you draw me so much?”
    </p>

    <p>
    “I don’t—”
    </p>

    <p>
    “Liar.” Moon’s foot hooked around Kommit’s ankle. “Dare, then. Let me paint your nails.”
    </p>

    <p>
    “No.”
    </p>

    <p>
    “Coward.”
    </p>

    <p>
    Kommit snatched the polish—metallic purple—and painted Moon’s instead. His hands shook. Moon’s fingers were calloused, knuckles scarred, but he held them like glass.
    </p>

    <p>
    Things unraveled during a heatwave.
    </p>

    <p>
    Moon stormed in, hoodie discarded, revealing a crop top that bared his midriff. Kommit’s pencil snapped.
    </p>

    <p>
    “Like what you see?” Moon smirked.
    </p>

    <p>
    “You’re sweaty,” Kommit lied.
    </p>

    <p>
    Moon straddled his lap. “Liar.”
    </p>

    <p>
    And then—chaos. Lips clashing, teeth nipping, Kommit’s back hitting the floorboards as Moon kissed like he fought: all hunger and no mercy.
    </p>

    <p>
    “Still hate me?” Moon breathed.
    </p>

    <p>
    Kommit flipped them, pinning Moon’s wrists. “Shut up.”
    </p>

    <p>
    Moon’s grin faltered. His cheeks flushed violet. “Oh. Oh.”
    </p>

    <p>
    Afterwards, Kommit traced the moon pendant around Moon’s neck.
    </p>

    <p>
    “I’m not in love with you,” he muttered.
    </p>

    <p>
    Moon nipped his jaw. “Keep telling yourself that.”
    </p>

    <p>
    “I mean it.”
    </p>

    <p>
    “Sure.” Moon tangled their legs together. “But you’ll stick around?”
    </p>

    <p>
    Kommit sighed. Like he had a choice. Like he’d ever wanted one.
    </p>

    <p>
    “...Yeah.”
    </p>

    <p>
    Moon’s smile glowed brighter than any nightlight.
    The attic was their world now, a place where time seemed to stretch and warp, where the outside world felt like a distant memory. Moon and Kommit had carved out a life here, a strange, messy, beautiful life that revolved around each other.
    </p>

    <p>
    Moon stretched out on the floor, his long limbs sprawled like a starfish, his purple hoodie riding up to reveal a sliver of his stomach. Kommit sat nearby, his sketchbook open, pencil moving in quick, precise strokes.
    </p>

    <p>
    “What are you drawing now?” Moon asked, tilting his head to catch a glimpse.
    </p>

    <p>
    “Nothing,” Kommit said quickly, snapping the book shut.
    </p>

    <p>
    Moon smirked. “Let me see.”
    </p>

    <p>
    “No.”
    </p>

    <p>
    “Come on, Kommit. Don’t be shy.” Moon lunged for the sketchbook, but Kommit held it out of reach.
    </p>

    <p>
    “You’re such a child,” Kommit muttered, though there was no real bite to his words.
    </p>

    <p>
    “And you’re a terrible liar,” Moon shot back, grinning. “Just show me.”
    </p>

    <p>
    Kommit sighed, relenting. He handed the sketchbook over, his cheeks tinged pink.
    </p>

    <p>
    Moon flipped through the pages, his grin widening with each drawing. There were sketches of him—sleeping, laughing, scowling—each one capturing his essence with startling accuracy.
    </p>

    <p>
    “You’re obsessed with me,” Moon teased, his voice dripping with amusement.
    </p>

    <p>
    “I’m not,” Kommit protested, though his blush deepened.
    </p>

    <p>
    “You are,” Moon insisted, leaning in close. “Admit it.”
    </p>

    <p>
    Kommit shoved him away, but there was no real force behind it. “You’re insufferable.”
    </p>

    <p>
    “And yet, you keep drawing me,” Moon said, his grin widening.
    </p>

    <p>
    Kommit didn’t respond, but the corner of his mouth twitched, betraying his amusement.
    </p>

    <p>
    The days blurred together, each one marked by their playful bickering and quiet moments of intimacy. Moon continued to tease Kommit relentlessly, his sharp tongue and quick wit keeping Kommit on his toes. But beneath the teasing was a deep affection, a bond that had grown stronger with each passing day.
    </p>

    <p>
    One evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the attic in hues of orange and pink, Moon found Kommit staring out the cracked window.
    </p>

    <p>
    “What’s on your mind?” Moon asked, leaning against the wall beside him.
    </p>

    <p>
    “Nothing,” Kommit said, his voice soft.
    </p>

    <p>
    Moon raised an eyebrow. “You’re a terrible liar, you know that?”
    </p>

    <p>
    Kommit sighed, running a hand through his hair. “I just… I wonder what it’s like out there. Beyond this attic.”
    </p>

    <p>
    Moon’s expression softened. “You miss it?”
    </p>

    <p>
    “Sometimes,” Kommit admitted. “But… I don’t know. It’s not like I have much to go back to.”
    </p>

    <p>
    Moon nudged him gently. “You’ve got me.”
    </p>

    <p>
    Kommit glanced at him, a small smile tugging at his lips. “Yeah. I’ve got you.”
    </p>

    <p>
    The storm came without warning, the sky darkening as thunder rumbled in the distance. Moon’s usual bravado faltered, his hands trembling as he pulled his hoodie tighter around himself.
    </p>

    <p>
    Kommit noticed immediately. “You okay?”
    </p>

    <p>
    “Fine,” Moon said, though his voice wavered.
    </p>

    <p>
    Kommit didn’t press. Instead, he moved closer, his presence a silent comfort.
    </p>

    <p>
    The first crack of thunder made Moon flinch, his breath hitching. Kommit reached out, his hand finding Moon’s.
    </p>

    <p>
    “It’s just a storm,” Kommit said softly.
    </p>

    <p>
    “I know,” Moon muttered, though his grip tightened.
    </p>

    <p>
    Kommit hesitated, then pulled Moon into his arms. Moon stiffened for a moment before relaxing, his head resting against Kommit’s shoulder.
    </p>

    <p>
    “You’re safe,” Kommit murmured, his voice steady.
    </p>

    <p>
    Moon didn’t respond, but his trembling slowly subsided, his breathing evening out.
    </p>

    <p>
    The storm passed, leaving the attic in a peaceful silence. Moon pulled away, his cheeks tinged with color.
    </p>

    <p>
    “Thanks,” he muttered, avoiding Kommit’s gaze.
    </p>

    <p>
    Kommit shrugged. “Don’t mention it.”
    </p>

    <p>
    Moon glanced at him, a small smile tugging at his lips. “You’re not so bad, you know that?”
    </p>

    <p>
    Kommit raised an eyebrow. “High praise coming from you.”
    </p>

    <p>
    Moon laughed, the sound warm and genuine. “Don’t let it go to your head.”
    </p>

    <p>
    Moon stretched, arms reaching high above his head, smirking as he glanced down at Kommit. “You know, it’s kind of adorable how I always have to look down at you.”
    </p>

    <p>
    Kommit exhaled sharply through his nose. “Oh, shut up already.”
    </p>

    <p>
    Moon only grinned wider, stepping closer, crowding into Kommit’s space like he always did. “Make me.”
    </p>

    <p>
    Kommit didn’t shove him this time. Didn’t roll his eyes or turn away. Instead, he grabbed Moon by the hoodie and yanked him down, crashing their mouths together in a kiss that was all sharp edges and unspoken words. Moon made a surprised noise before melting into it, hands gripping the front of Kommit’s sweater, pulling him closer.
    </p>

    <p>
    When they finally broke apart, Kommit’s face was flushed, lips parted as he muttered, “There. Shut up.”
    </p>

    <p>
    Moon blinked, dazed, then let out a breathless laugh. “Okay. That was unfair.”
    </p>

    <p>
    Kommit huffed, turning to grab his sketchbook as if that would somehow erase what had just happened. But Moon wasn’t done. He caught Kommit’s wrist, tugging him back just enough to press one last, lingering kiss against his cheek.
    </p>

    <p>
    “Just so you know,” Moon murmured, voice softer now, “I kinda like it when you don’t shut up.”
    </p>

    <p>
    Kommit rolled his eyes, but the way his fingers curled around Moon’s sleeve said something else entirely.
    </p>

    <p>
    The attic was still their prison. Still their sanctuary. But maybe—just maybe—it was starting to feel a little more like home.
    </p>

Only me and a specific someone is going to see this. But I'm doing this in the offchance it's not. Why are the line breaks not working? Man, this sucks. And would you look at that, proper capitalization and punctuation Kommit. No sign of lowercase tomfoolery too! This is insane. Have I messed around enough? Gee, this would've been so much shorter if it had proper line breaks. One last thing - I tried to replace a lot of the links here to not redirect you to AO3, but I might've missed some.
