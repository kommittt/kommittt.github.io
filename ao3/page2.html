    <p>
      The attic was quiet, save for the faint hum of the old house settling around them. Moon lounged on the floor, his long legs stretched out, one foot nudging Kommit‚Äôs thigh as he flipped through a battered magazine he‚Äôd found in one of the dusty boxes. Kommit sat a few feet away, sketchbook in hand, pencil moving in quick, precise strokes.  
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre staring again,‚Äù Moon said without looking up, a smirk tugging at his lips.  
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not,‚Äù Kommit muttered, his pencil pausing mid-stroke.  
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúLiar.‚Äù Moon glanced over, his grin widening. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been staring at me for, like, ten minutes. Admit it. You‚Äôre obsessed.‚Äù  
      <br><br>
      Kommit‚Äôs cheeks flushed, and he snapped the sketchbook shut. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not obsessed. You‚Äôre just‚Ä¶ distracting.‚Äù  
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúDistracting, huh?‚Äù Moon tossed the magazine aside and crawled closer, his movements slow and deliberate. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs so distracting about me, huh?‚Äù  
      <br><br>
      Kommit leaned back, trying to put space between them, but Moon followed, crowding into his personal space like he always did. ‚ÄúYour ego, for one.‚Äù  
      <br><br>
      Moon laughed, the sound warm and rich. ‚ÄúMy ego? That‚Äôs what‚Äôs got you all flustered?‚Äù  
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not flustered,‚Äù Kommit said, though the way his voice cracked betrayed him.  
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúSure you‚Äôre not.‚Äù Moon reached out, plucking the sketchbook from Kommit‚Äôs hands. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see what‚Äôs got you so distracted, then.‚Äù  
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúGive that back,‚Äù Kommit snapped, lunging for the book, but Moon held it out of reach, flipping it open.  
      <br><br>
      The page was filled with sketches of Moon‚Äîsleeping, laughing, scowling‚Äîeach one capturing his essence with startling accuracy. Moon‚Äôs grin softened, his teasing edge fading as he traced a finger over one of the drawings.  
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúYou really do think I‚Äôm pretty, huh?‚Äù he said, his voice quieter now.  
      <br><br>
      Kommit‚Äôs face burned, and he snatched the sketchbook back. ‚ÄúShut up.‚Äù  
      <br><br>
      Moon didn‚Äôt push. Instead, he leaned back on his hands, tilting his head as he studied Kommit. ‚ÄúYou know, for someone who claims to hate me, you sure do draw me a lot.‚Äù  
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt hate you,‚Äù Kommit muttered, his gaze fixed on the floor.  
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúCould‚Äôve fooled me,‚Äù Moon said, his tone light but his eyes serious.  
      <br><br>
      Kommit didn‚Äôt respond, his fingers tightening around the sketchbook.  
      <br><br>

      The argument started over something stupid‚Äîa misplaced hoodie, a careless comment, a moment of miscommunication. But it escalated quickly, their words sharp and biting, each one cutting deeper than the last.  
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so damn selfish,‚Äù Kommit snapped, his voice trembling with anger. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt think about anyone but yourself.‚Äù  
      <br><br>
      Moon‚Äôs eyes narrowed, his usual smirk replaced by a scowl. ‚ÄúSelfish? Really? That‚Äôs rich coming from you.‚Äù  
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that supposed to mean?‚Äù  
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúIt means you‚Äôre so wrapped up in your own little world that you don‚Äôt even notice when someone‚Äôs trying to care about you,‚Äù Moon shot back, his voice rising.  
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúOh, please,‚Äù Kommit said, rolling his eyes. ‚ÄúLike you care about anyone but yourself.‚Äù  
      <br><br>
      Moon‚Äôs jaw tightened, and for a moment, it looked like he might say something else. But instead, he turned on his heel and stormed out of the attic, slamming the door behind him.  
      <br><br>
      Kommit stood frozen, his chest heaving, the sound of the door slamming echoing in his ears. He sank to the floor, his sketchbook slipping from his hands as he buried his face in his knees.  
      <br><br>
      ---  
      <br><br>
      Hours passed, the attic growing colder as the sun dipped below the horizon. Kommit sat in the dim light, his thoughts a tangled mess of regret and frustration. He hated fighting with Moon. Hated the way his words had cut so deep. Hated the way Moon‚Äôs absence left a hollow ache in his chest.  
      <br><br>
      The door creaked open, and Kommit looked up to see Moon standing in the doorway, his hoodie pulled tight around him, his expression unreadable.  
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù Moon said, his voice quiet but steady.  
      <br><br>
      Kommit blinked, caught off guard. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù  
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù Moon repeated, stepping into the room. ‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt have said what I said. I didn‚Äôt mean it.‚Äù  
      <br><br>
      Kommit‚Äôs throat tightened, and he looked away. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry too. I didn‚Äôt mean to call you selfish.‚Äù  
      <br><br>
      Moon crossed the room, dropping to his knees in front of Kommit. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not selfish, Kommit. You‚Äôre just‚Ä¶ guarded. And that‚Äôs okay. I get it.‚Äù  
      <br><br>
      Kommit‚Äôs eyes flicked up to meet Moon‚Äôs, and for a moment, they just stared at each other, the tension between them palpable.  
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt hate you,‚Äù Kommit said finally, his voice barely above a whisper.  
      <br><br>
      Moon‚Äôs lips curved into a small smile. ‚ÄúI know.‚Äù  
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm not‚Ä¶ obsessed,‚Äù Kommit added, though the way his gaze dropped to Moon‚Äôs lips betrayed him.  
      <br><br>
      Moon chuckled, leaning in closer. ‚ÄúSure you‚Äôre not.‚Äù  
      <br><br>
      Kommit‚Äôs breath hitched as Moon‚Äôs hand came up to cup his cheek, his touch gentle but firm.  
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre such a liar,‚Äù Moon murmured, his voice warm with affection.  
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúShut up,‚Äù Kommit muttered, but there was no bite to his words.  
      <br><br>
      Moon grinned, closing the distance between them in a kiss that was soft and slow, a stark contrast to their earlier argument. Kommit‚Äôs hands found their way to Moon‚Äôs waist, pulling him closer as the tension between them melted away.  
      <br><br>
      When they finally broke apart, Moon rested his forehead against Kommit‚Äôs, his breath warm against Kommit‚Äôs lips.  
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still insufferable,‚Äù Kommit muttered, though the way his fingers tightened around Moon‚Äôs hoodie said something else entirely.  
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúStill yours, though,‚Äù Moon replied, his grin widening.  
      <br><br>
      Kommit rolled his eyes, but the smile tugging at his lips gave him away.  
      <br><br>
      The attic was still their prison. Still their sanctuary. But maybe‚Äîjust maybe‚Äîit was starting to feel a little more like home.  
      <br><br>
      ---  
      <br><br>
      Later that night, as they lay tangled together on the floor, Moon‚Äôs head resting on Kommit‚Äôs chest, Kommit traced idle patterns on Moon‚Äôs back, his thoughts drifting.  
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúYou know,‚Äù Moon said, breaking the silence, ‚Äúyou‚Äôd look really good in a skirt.‚Äù  
      <br><br>
      Kommit groaned, shoving Moon off him. ‚ÄúShut up.‚Äù  
      <br><br>
      Moon laughed, the sound warm and bright, and Kommit couldn‚Äôt help but smile.  
      <br><br>
      ---
      <br><br>
      Moon laughed, the sound warm and bright, and Kommit couldn‚Äôt help but smile. Moon flopped back down, his head landing on Kommit‚Äôs chest again, his fingers idly tracing patterns on Kommit‚Äôs shirt.
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúI‚Äôm serious, though,‚Äù Moon said, his tone teasing but with a hint of sincerity. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd rock a skirt. You‚Äôve got the whole brooding artist thing going on. It‚Äôd be iconic.‚Äù
      <br><br>
      Kommit groaned, shoving Moon‚Äôs face away. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre such a dumbass. Why are you like this?‚Äù
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôm amazing,‚Äù Moon said, grinning as he batted Kommit‚Äôs hand away. ‚ÄúAnd you love me.‚Äù
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúI tolerate you,‚Äù Kommit corrected, though the way his fingers lingered in Moon‚Äôs hair said otherwise.
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúSame thing,‚Äù Moon said, closing his eyes and nuzzling closer. ‚ÄúAdmit it. You‚Äôd miss me if I wasn‚Äôt around.‚Äù
      <br><br>
      Kommit didn‚Äôt answer right away, his fingers stilling in Moon‚Äôs hair. Moon cracked one eye open, peeking up at him. ‚ÄúKommit?‚Äù
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúShut up,‚Äù Kommit muttered, his voice softer now. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not going anywhere.‚Äù
      <br><br>
      Moon‚Äôs grin softened, and he reached up to poke Kommit‚Äôs cheek. ‚ÄúAw, you do care.‚Äù
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúI take it back,‚Äù Kommit said, swatting his hand away. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the worst.‚Äù
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúYour sketches say otherwise,‚Äù Moon said, laughing as Kommit shoved him off again.
      <br><br>
      ---
      <br><br>
      The next morning, the attic was bathed in golden sunlight, the dust motes floating lazily in the air. Kommit woke up first, his sketchbook still open beside him, a half-finished drawing of Moon sleeping sprawled across the page. He glanced down at Moon, who was still out cold, his face smushed against Kommit‚Äôs shoulder, his hair a complete mess.
      <br><br>
      Kommit smirked and reached for his pencil, adding a few more details to the drawing‚Äîthe way Moon‚Äôs mouth was slightly open, the way his hoodie was bunched up around his waist. He was so focused that he didn‚Äôt notice Moon stirring until a hand reached out and snatched the sketchbook from his lap.
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúHey!‚Äù Kommit protested, trying to grab it back, but Moon held it out of reach, sitting up and flipping through the pages.
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúDude,‚Äù Moon said, his voice full of mock offense. ‚ÄúDo you just draw me in my sleep like some kind of creepy artist stalker?‚Äù
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúShut up,‚Äù Kommit said, his face heating up. ‚ÄúGive it back.‚Äù
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúNo way,‚Äù Moon said, grinning as he flipped to another page. ‚ÄúThis is gold. Look at this one! I look so cool. You even got my good side.‚Äù
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have a good side,‚Äù Kommit muttered, lunging for the sketchbook again.
      <br><br>
      Moon laughed, holding it above his head. ‚ÄúAdmit it. You think I‚Äôm your muse or something.‚Äù
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not my muse,‚Äù Kommit said, glaring at him. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just‚Ä¶ convenient.‚Äù
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúConvenient, huh?‚Äù Moon said, leaning in closer, his grin widening. ‚ÄúIs that why you‚Äôve got, like, fifty drawings of me in here?‚Äù
      <br><br>
      Kommit‚Äôs face was fully red now, and he grabbed a pillow, smacking Moon with it. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre such an idiot.‚Äù
      <br><br>
      Moon laughed, dodging the pillow and tossing the sketchbook aside. ‚ÄúYour idiot,‚Äù he said, tackling Kommit back onto the floor.
      <br><br>
      Kommit groaned, but he was laughing now, shoving at Moon‚Äôs shoulders as Moon pinned him down. ‚ÄúGet off me, you dumbass.‚Äù
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúMake me,‚Äù Moon said, grinning down at him.
      <br><br>
      Kommit rolled his eyes, but he didn‚Äôt try too hard to push Moon away. Instead, he reached up, tugging lightly on Moon‚Äôs hair. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the worst.‚Äù
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúYeah, yeah,‚Äù Moon said, leaning down to kiss him. ‚ÄúYou love me.‚Äù
      <br><br>
      Kommit didn‚Äôt argue this time.
      <br><br>
      ---
      <br><br>
      Later, they were sitting by the attic window, their legs dangling over the edge, the cool breeze ruffling their hair. Moon was humming some stupid pop song under his breath, his shoulder pressed against Kommit‚Äôs.
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so bad at that,‚Äù Kommit said, nudging him.
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúBad at what?‚Äù Moon asked, feigning innocence.
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúSinging,‚Äù Kommit said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre tone-deaf, bro.‚Äù
      <br><br>
      Moon gasped, clutching his chest like he‚Äôd been wounded. ‚ÄúRude. I‚Äôm a musical genius.‚Äù
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúSure you are,‚Äù Kommit said, rolling his eyes. ‚ÄúNext you‚Äôre gonna tell me you‚Äôre a secret rock star.‚Äù
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúI could be,‚Äù Moon said, grinning. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know my life.‚Äù
      <br><br>
      Kommit snorted, shaking his head. ‚ÄúYou're so dumb.‚Äù
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúSays you,‚Äù Moon said, leaning his head on Kommit‚Äôs shoulder.
      <br><br>
      Kommit didn‚Äôt say anything, but he didn‚Äôt push Moon away either. They sat there in comfortable silence, the world outside the attic feeling far away, like it didn‚Äôt matter. For now, it was just the two of them, the way it always was.
      <br><br>
      And maybe, Kommit thought, that wasn‚Äôt such a bad thing.
      <br><br>
      ---
      <br><br>
      The attic‚Äôs single dangling lightbulb flickered as Kommit scowled at his laptop screen, his fingers stabbing at the trackpad. A half-finished beat pulsed through his headphones‚Äîglitchy, distorted, *angry*. Exactly how he felt. Across the room, Moon was sprawled on the floor, scribbling lyrics in a battered notebook, humming a melody under his breath that made Kommit‚Äôs jaw tighten. He knew that tune. Moon had stolen it from a hook Kommit had abandoned months ago.  
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre using the C# progression again,‚Äù Kommit said flatly, yanking off his headphones. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs mine.‚Äù  
      <br><br>
      Moon didn‚Äôt look up. ‚ÄúNah, I fixed it. Your version was depressing.‚Äù  
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúIt was *supposed* to be depressing.‚Äù  
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúYeah, well, now it‚Äôs a banger.‚Äù Moon finally glanced up, his grin softer than usual. ‚ÄúFace it, bro‚Äîyou‚Äôre better at sad-boy ambient crap. Let me handle the hooks.‚Äù  
      <br><br>
      Kommit‚Äôs fist clenched around his pen. They‚Äôd had this fight a hundred times. Moon took Kommit‚Äôs raw, moody sketches and polished them into glittering pop traps, then acted like he‚Äôd done him a favor. Worse, he was usually right. Their collabs blew up every time, but Kommit hated how Moon could twist his pain into something punchy and palatable. Like he was editing his *soul*.  
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre such a sellout,‚Äù Kommit muttered.  
      <br><br>
      Moon‚Äôs grin faltered, and he set his notebook aside. ‚ÄúSays the guy who ghostwrote that ballad for Nova Lane last week. How much did that check clear for? Five zeros? Six?‚Äù  
      <br><br>
      Kommit flinched. He‚Äôd told Moon that in confidence, drunk and frustrated at 3 a.m., and now he wished he could claw the words back. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs different.‚Äù  
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúHow? Because you used a fake name? Because you don‚Äôt wanna admit you‚Äôre just as hungry as the rest of us?‚Äù Moon‚Äôs voice wasn‚Äôt sharp‚Äîit was almost gentle, like he was trying to understand. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not some tortured artist, Kommit. You‚Äôre just‚Ä¶ scared.‚Äù  
      <br><br>
      The air crackled. Kommit stood, his chair screeching against the floor. ‚ÄúScared of what?‚Äù  
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúOf letting people in,‚Äù Moon said simply. He stood too, his hands shoved in his pockets. ‚ÄúOf letting *me* in. You‚Äôd rather call me a sellout than admit we make a good team.‚Äù  
      <br><br>
      Kommit‚Äôs chest tightened. He looked away, his voice barely above a whisper. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that simple.‚Äù  
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúIt could be,‚Äù Moon said, stepping closer. ‚ÄúIf you let it.‚Äù  
      <br><br>
      For a heartbeat, they just stared at each other, the silence thick with every unsaid thing‚Äîthe late nights finishing each other‚Äôs tracks, the demos they‚Äôd sent back and forth for years, the way Moon always knew when Kommit‚Äôs anxiety was spiking and would spam him with stupid memes until he laughed.  
      <br><br>
      Kommit broke first. ‚ÄúJust‚Ä¶ stay out of my stems, okay?‚Äù  
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúMake me,‚Äù Moon said, quieter now.  
      <br><br>
      They both knew he wouldn‚Äôt.  
      <br><br>
      ---
      <br><br>
      Later, Kommit found Moon on the rooftop, staring at the city skyline, a crumpled pack of cigarettes in his hand. He didn‚Äôt smoke, but he always carried them when he was stressed.  
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre gonna give yourself lung cancer for no reason,‚Äù Kommit said, leaning against the doorframe.  
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre such a mom,‚Äù Moon shot back, but he tucked the pack away.  
      <br><br>
      Kommit hesitated, then sat beside him, their shoulders brushing. The tension wasn‚Äôt gone, but it had softened into something tired and familiar.  
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúRemember that first track we made?‚Äù Moon said suddenly. ‚ÄúThe one with the rain samples and your sister‚Äôs cat meowing?‚Äù  
      <br><br>
      Kommit groaned. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt. It was terrible.‚Äù  
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúNah, it was *art*. Deep, bro. Philosophical.‚Äù Moon bumped his shoulder against Kommit‚Äôs. ‚ÄúYou cried when I added those 808s.‚Äù  
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúI did not‚Äî‚Äù  
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúYou *wept*. Said it ‚Äòruined the aesthetic.‚Äô‚Äù  
      <br><br>
      Kommit hid his smile in his hoodie. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre delusional.‚Äù  
      <br><br>
      Moon leaned back on his hands, his tone shifting. ‚ÄúWhy‚Äôd you really take that Nova Lane gig?‚Äù  
      <br><br>
      The question hung there. Kommit picked at a loose thread on his sleeve. ‚ÄúNeeded the money.‚Äù  
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúBullshit. You‚Äôve got money.‚Äù  
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúMaybe I wanted to prove I could do it. Write something‚Ä¶ perfect.‚Äù  
      <br><br>
      Moon snorted. ‚ÄúNothing‚Äôs perfect. That‚Äôs why you‚Äôve got me.‚Äù  
      <br><br>
      Kommit glanced at him. Moon was staring straight ahead, his usual smirk replaced by something raw and rare.  
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Kommit said softly. ‚ÄúGuess I do.‚Äù  
      <br><br>
      ---
      <br><br>
      Three a.m. found them side by side at Kommit‚Äôs laptop, passing a bag of stale chips back and forth as they dissected the track. Moon‚Äôs stolen hook bled into Kommit‚Äôs brooding synths, morphing into something neither of them could‚Äôve made alone‚Äîhaunting but hopeful, messy but magnetic.  
      <br><br>
      ‚ÄúTold you,‚Äù Moon said when they finally leaned back, exhausted and weirdly proud. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre better together.‚Äù  
      <br><br>
      Kommit didn‚Äôt argue. He saved the project file as *Sellout_Hypocrite_Final_Final2* and let Moon fall asleep on his shoulder, their unfinished fight lingering in the air like a suspended chord.

It is currently 3:29 as I'm writing this. It's worth it.\nI need to write more text here so it's more believable. So yeah. \n\n  Hi! How was your day? Why am I doing this? Only me and a specific someone is going to see this. But I'm doing this in the offchance it's not. Why are the line breaks not working? Man, this sucks. And would you look at that, proper capitalization and punctuation Kommit. No sign of lowercase tomfoolery too! This is insane. Have I messed around enough? Gee, this would've been so much shorter if it had proper line breaks. One last thing - I tried to replace a lot of the links here to not redirect you to AO3, but I might've missed some.
