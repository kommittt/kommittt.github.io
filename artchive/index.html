            hi there!!
            
            <br>artchive has been cancelled because it's a hassle to do,,
            <br>
            <br>it seemed like such a pain to collect and archive everything
            <br>
            <br>i dont usually export every single drawing i have either, so i'd
            <br>have to check Every Single project file for them
            <br>
            <br>and its a huge problem, especially sincei have scattered doodles
            <br>across so many devices and apps, and thats not even including
            <br>my real life sketchbooks...
            <br>
            <br>theres also running out of storage in github AND the fact that
            <br>if i want this to work, i have to update the site everytime i
            <br>have a new drawing fgdgsfaa
            <br>
            <br>im not exactly the most, uh, consistent or motivated person
            <br>
            <br>theres also a slight fear of everything being stolen by someone
            <br>because i never watermark/sign my drawing, or training data
            <br>
            <br>sooo yeah! thats all! ill keep this page for now, dont feel like
            <br>updating my site to reflect the changes right now
        </p>
