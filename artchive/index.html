            hi there!! artchive has been cancelled because it's a hassle to do,,
            <br>
            <br>ill keep this page here for now! not feeling like updating my
            <br>entire site to reflect this sudden change :p
            <br>
            <br>anyways!
            <br>i cancelled this because, as i said, it seemed like such a pain
            <br>to collect and archive everything
            <br>
            <br>i dont usually export every single thing i have either, so i'd
            <br>have to check Every Single Project file for them
            <br>
            <br>especially since i have scattered doodles across so many
            <br>devices and apps, not including my real life sketchbooks,,
            <br>
            <br>theres also running out of storage in github AND the fact that
            <br>if i want this to work, i have to update the site everytime i
            <br>have a new drawing
            <br>
            <br>and im not exactly the most, uh, consistent person fgghfgdsf
            <br>
            <br>theres also a slight fear of everything being stolen by someone
            <br>because i never watermark/sign my drawing, or training data
            <br>
            <br>sooo yeah! thats all
        </p>

        <br>* It's best if you just forget about me, OK?
