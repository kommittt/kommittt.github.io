                    since i'm still new to commissions, these terms might change over time - they shouldn't be too drastic of an update however
                    <br>i think ive covered most (if not all) of the important things here, so any future changes should be minor additions, clarifications, or a cleaner page

                        <br>let me clarify that i am not at all fluent in legalese or being formal in general, so i will write like how i usually do
                        <br>i hope what i wrote is readable enough :p

                                    <li> i prefer full upfront, but in case you're unable to, i can be flexible!
                                    <br> im willing to do a half deposit (other half will be paid after commission is complete) OR you can pay after i'm done </li>

                                    <li> if you want to cancel, please let me know asap!! i will only charge you for the work done until that point

                                    <li> i get pretty busy and procrastinate a LOT, so the downtime will take a while :')
                                    <br> i normally mute notifications from most websites and apps, so i may miss out on some important stuff
                                    <br> <strong>i rely heavily on ko-fi's notifications</strong> !! this is why i prefer it than direct payments as i can miss it </li>
                                    <li> i will try my best to notify you if i am currently unable to start/continue your request </li>
                                    <li> so far however, it has taken me <strong>three days minimum</strong> to complete them </li> 
                                    <li> if it's urgent and want me to get it done quick, tell me
                                    <br> ill do what i can to free up my schedule, though rushing me usually worsens the final result </li></ol>

                                <span class="uh">･⋆✦≫ how long does drawing usually take you?</span> <ol>
                                    <li> usually for sketches, when im feeling great, as low as 5-15 minutes</li>
                                    <li> i get distracted a lot (curse my short attention span), so sometimes it can take up to 5 hours :')
                                    <br> when im truly locked in (very very rare instance), a full body and shaded art can take as short as 2-3 hours </li>
                                    <li> anyways im just yapping at this point LMFAO tldr shortest is 15 mins, longest 5+ hours</li> </ol>

                                <span class="uh">･⋆✦≫ my process</span> <ol>
                                    <li> unless requested otherwise, i will <strong>work by myself</strong> and not provide updates
                                    <br> please notify me beforehand if you want to see progress pics so i message you in the platform (if theres a chat) or message you via twitter/discord
                                    <li> by default, reference sheets will be annoying you >:P (updating you every change)</li>
                                    <li> i will update you after every <strong>"milestone"</strong> (pose/sketch/colour/shade) so i can draw it exactly how you want it! </li> </ol>

                                <span class="uh">･⋆✦≫ edits/revisions</span> <ol>
                                    <li> minor edits (changing colours, face, something that doesn't take a while) are completely free :)
                                    <li> as stated earlier, <strong>major edits will cost</strong>!! i consider major edits something that will take a while to correct 
                                    <br> example is adding a new character, changing the pose after lineart, different clothing, etc </li>
                                    <li> changing something major that requires a full redraw AFTER i'm done with the art is basically like a new commission !! </li>
                                    <li> i will tell you about these terms before committing to the edit </li>

                                        <li> my style tends to vary a lot!! i am <strong>VERY inconsistent</strong> on my art but it shouldnt look too... foreign
                                        <br> basically everything from line width, anatomy/proportions, shading, and colour can and may change!
                                        <br> it's mostly due to my frequent usage of references and also my tendency to play around/experiment with my drawings </li>
                                        <li> i will draw how im used to, which is freely, and under my own judgement!
                                        <br> i will not follow "shade in X style", "copy X's style" kinds of things </li>
                                        <li> im allowing "draw in X style" when its relevant and if im able to (example: draw character in the OMORI/Sonic artstyle) </li>
                                        <li> in case of suspicion of ai, i will gladly give the timelapse of my entire process</li>
