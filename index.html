                <br>- whole page in toki pona (dunno what, but its to help me learn)
                <br>- figure out a look for fanart page since artchive is already win7 (probably gonna settle for win10 vibe)
                <br>- finally start on music archive
                <br>- oh right images in the art stuff/fanart stuff first
                <br>- maybe even change the entire mobile view instead of win7 still
                <br>- ultrabox mabe change rows from 2 to 3
                <br>- i had another idea but i forgot what
                <br>- oh right its something that involves random text generator for art when bored

                    <br>i use <strong>fl studio</strong> for my music (older songs on fl mobile)! they're listenable, at the very least...
                    <br>most of my animations were made in <strong>flipaclip</strong>, some on <strong>adobe flash cs6</strong>
                    <br>id say my skills on fnf lua is... acceptable. source code however, absolutely the hell not
                    <br>my chart is playable :thumbsup:
                    <br>i mainly draw on <strong>krita</strong>! its free and open source, check it out
                    <br>
                    <br>i'd say im a jack of all trades, master of none! i know how to do all of them, but not exceptionally well
                    <br>
                    <br>unless you're my friend, <i>please dont ask me to work on your fnf mod</i> :')
                    <br>though i can help out <i>a little</i>, like making chromatics or covers
                    <br>im geniunely tired of modding unless im having fun of course
                    <br>i am extremely unreliable as i also struggle with talking to people so yeah
