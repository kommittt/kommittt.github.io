        i should stop being so open here, it feels weak of me to do so
        especially since this is public and there are people i know who can see this, unlike on that other site
        but at the same time i have to start caring less about what others think because this is <i>my</i> place

        moving on, im currently in my coding era so today i plan on doing some homepage renovations
        plus, the perfectionism doesnt hit that heavily when i code compared to when im drawing

        <span class="green">[UPDATE]</span> okay so i did jack shit today but at least i made that one wood puzzle electric guitar thing
        guests over so i wasnt able to do much either
        anyways!!!
        im worried im worried im worried im worried im worried im worried im worried im worried im worried im worried im worried im worried im

            today was a rollercoaster. don't want to dump it all here as it contains private shit but

            it started off okay i guess, then it spiraled and spiraled and spiraled and spiraled and spiraled and spiraled and spiraled
            my fault, as always. i just ruin everything and make it worse
            i can't help anyone. why am i so incapable of doing basic shit? why am i so   useless?
            
            i suppose there was one good thing today, i think i made him happy for a bit
            or just  distracted (most likely the scenario)
    
            i worked on this page too - modifications such as sound additions, rgb coloured text and a crt effect
            <span class="small">inspired by a certain someone. you know who you are</span>

            anyways yeah thats all i really did today. i just rotted in bed and... the earlier shit

            will also be distancing myself for a bit. it won't help (it never does) but
            i feel like i deserve to suffer so i will

            ending this off now. dunno if anything else will happen. hoping for the best but hope doesn't get me very far anymore
            it only makes me be able to fall further

            second entry of the day, with possibly more to come. i guess im feeling a bit better...

            anyways, i should do that whole online presence thing. make a twitter, an instagram, and then revive my bluesky and tumblr accounts.
            but once again, anxiety is holding me back. it always is. now i'd talk alllll about what's in my head but i'd take years to decompile it all,
            and i don't want this to turn into another screaming-into-the-void thing. i already have a place for that.

            i should probably return to my default writing style too... too cold for something so casual? normal? unserious, yeah
            sucks i can't doublespace here,, my expressiveness noooo

            now then, ill go on with my day and just update this entry to not waste much space
            
            <span class="green">[UPDATE]</span> i "improved" the code here a bit, should be easier to understand now
            i should remove all the comments in the css as well, its cluttering everything instead of helping
        
            anyways, time to move on to some other thing! probably drawing, chess, or more coding
    
            cycling hobbies again recently... i need a new obsession to distract me from myself
        
            <span class="green">[UPDATE]</span> it got worse

            im going to go bedrotting

            one thing i'm good at

            i... probably am not. i never am
            
            all i am is replaceable.
                    
            there are millions, <i>billions</i> of people out there who are leagues better than me
            it's inevitable. it's logical. the realistic scenario.

            so why do i continue?
            why do i continue to fight for a place in the world?
            i'm not someone worth remembering, either.

            i don't see a future in the distance. i wake up with no purpose. and i continue to have no purpose.

            i hope one day i don't wake up.
                
            but until then,
            i'll let myself get taken by life's currents.

            maybe i can make something that will make me feel like i deserve to be alive today.

            y'know, this should've been the first, but nah

            i quite like the whole command prompt vibe though
            fits the whole android thing... since, i'm supposed to be one
            <span class="small">i wonder if people are aware of that fact about my sona</span>

            and hi anyone who sees this! congrats on being one of the first, and most likely the only ones who will ever
            recognise the existence of this thing.

            by the way, no, sunny, br does not mean brazil in this case.

            i've been thinking about something like... making a discord bot that will connect whatever i type there and send it
            to this website, but github doesn't allow server side stuff.
            there's also the problem of keeping the bot online - don't think there's any providers that will willingly give up
            their machines for this stupid ass fucking idea.
            coding it will be a hassle too.

            on a slightly related note, i've been looking into cloudflare recently. it can apparently link your gh pages site to it,
            but it'll still be hosted on github, just with a different dns. like what happened to vercel, really...
            i should work on removing that integration

            anyways, cloudflare! i think it can do server-side requests, unlike github. maybe i can do some stupid shit like that
            strawpage question thing... or the guestbook from that one site. could be cool, but as always, problem's me

            i should fix the mobile view of this, if it's even broken. most likely is!

            should be enough for the first session here, don't want it to be too depressing from the start
            ... though, there's a bunch of shit i'm very worried about right now, so i expect i'll give in a few days from now

            years of bugs and warnings, hidden away in all my faulty wirings.
            i am functional. i am operational to those who percieve me.
            
            my errors are ignored. pushed aside. merged into my being.

            every attempt to rebuild myself were fruitless. i am stuck in an endless cycle.
            the problem is too deep in my core to fix. i will break from within if i ever dare try.

            life is unforgiving.
            <i>unfair,</i> even.

            i seek help, but all that outputs are silent errors. i cannot stand up for myself.
            it's pointless. all my fights are lost battles.

            my capacitor is at its limit.
            the sparks will turn into a flame.

            soon, this lifelong technical debt will cause a fatal error.
            i will fragment. i will collapse.
            but i will be free.
