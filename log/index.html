                hi to the people who visit this site! this is targeted to those who are following the uhhh  ub:sr thing!
                i check my guestbook nearly every day and i see you! its added to the queue :]
                im also gonna make a user submitted category for those who send individual files instead of soundfonts stuff
                and of course, everyone will be credited

                i wont work on the update immediately though cause im busy with irl stuff and a project im working on with my friend
                but yeah! i know i said that i wont put ubsr updates here but like.. yeah.

                anyhow heres some changelogs:
                - added github actions to hopefully port my site over to neocities
                - updated ubsr queue and added the user submitted category
                - minor changes to links, homepage, terms
                - added wip page /utdr-heardle/
                - responded to gimmicks on my strawpage and added more art

                future plans:
                - make guestbook have a verified me colour (so people wont impersonate me lol)
                - ubsr major update planned (hopefully either clear or at the very least halve the queue)
                - add status cafe
                - add links to websites and make my own shareable button
                - revamp log maybe using either more guestbook code or a separate txt file so its organised

                well somehow im still alive and kicking! unfortunately that comes with doing all the work thats piled up over the past several months now
                this whole entry will be the entirety (or more like end) of january's logs all in one

                anyways, changelog time. ill be ordering them in chronological order and no date updates cause its gettin long
                <span class="green">[UPDATE]</span> will be compressing them !!! before the compression this whole update log had <span class="blue">32 lines</span>
                also its february now but for the sake of convenience ill put every update in here until i push it out

                - added /commissions/ and subpages queue/ (later removed) and terms/ cause i do them now (somehow)
                  life's funny   i never wouldve expected it to work out
                - /ultrabox/ now has a hiatus notice. it'll be back once i recode the script that i made to make things easier (lost it) and once i got energy
                  sorry for the like   3 people who use it idk
                - /pona/ revisited! themed to look similar to a PSP, one of my favourite consoles
                - disc in /komi/ rotates now (even if it breaks a little bit)
                - added icons to pages missing them and moved some files around, mightve broken some stuff
                - deleted /disgrace/, repurposed into a custom error page (finally stole an idea from aster)
                - /guestbook/'s entire theme has been remade :]
                - /sitemap/ added
                - added /paint/ which is just strawpage and my fanart-corner idea put into one!
                - /links/ done! pretty much a linktr.ee but in-site
                - /artchive/, /song-dump/, and secret page minor update
                - wip page template made, and created a few pages that i plan on working soon, like /protoclicker/
                - /about-me/ done, added wip subpage characters/
                - homepage remodel finally fucking done and theres some details that i really love about it !!!!!
                - removed tracking stuff (as best as i can) in iframes
                - /the-archives/ made for old stuff
                - last bits of file management (making sure everything in archive is working and pages are properly linked)
                - more splash text as usual

                <summary class="logtitle">ENTRY 5 - 11/11/2025, || <u>how the fuck do i code again</u></summary>
                uh hiii i guess
                <span class="small">gosh its been so long since i touched this site i lowkey feel lost</span>

                gonna push out some updates that i left over the past few months with a few minor additions
                might proceed with the whole  homepage revamp over the next days if i feel like it
                problem is, i gotta have energy and the will to live for that which is , kind of rare right now

                i also need to update ub:sr :sob: so much stuff to do
                oh and the artchive thing too fuckkkk

                AND the auto updating feed for my socials as well im so cooked bruh

                tldr lots of stuff planned - very little motivation
                while in the meantime i have to be doing something far more important than this :broken_heart:
                oh yeah the whole switch to bootstrap too im so fucking scared bruh

                ill be taking inspiration from a specific site i found cool
                oh maybe im gonna incorporate a music player in there too... maybe of my own songs but that feels a bit self centered
                ugh yeah the more i linger around here the more ideas i have and the more overwhelmed i feel

                im rambling again

                oops i forgot to write a log yesterday
                hmm maybe i should make this an update log instead of a diary... too personal

                anyways uh! yeah i think this will be an update log with a side of irl stuff
                because i only ever get to touch this log page when im modifying the site and stuff
                
                regardless, maaaaassive update like HUGE
                i really hope its not a pain for the others to migrate...
                im gonna put a message on the old page with a redirect so its not a hassle for them,

                and then uhh... very slight fix for guestbook (thanks ellieee)

                i think that's all! i need to finish up the redirect then ill finally push

                uh, i worked on some more ultrabox stuff and refined the python script even further
                if i locked in then id probably be done by tomorrow but i didn't so

                planning a remodel for ub:sr, its getting too laggy. i have a vision in mind, lets hope i can implement it

                then im trying to put that guestbook thing i saw
                it can read the data in the spreadsheet but not write. something's wrong, i think i missed something
                need to check the template again or  maybe i messed with the code too much...

                frustrated, irritated, and annoyed. at myself. unrelated to what i just wrote
                ufgh i  hate myself

                :/

                ...people are going to see this. i  dont want it to be in full display so im putting the original log somewhere safer
                i might still update this but with a lot less,    um   personal stuff

                im going to use this thing as my  yknow, site after all and its gonna be in basically all of my social medias
                no doubt someone is going to find this... but at the same time, its <i>my</i> site and i do whatever i want here
                i ultimately make the decisions, but   its personal hvghsah i  dont like being seen i dont like feeling   unsafe
                ill  think about it.

                uh anyways i coded a python script that makes my life easier for the ultrabox page thing
                nothin too special! instead of copy pasting directly on the html (which is really fuckin confusing and tiring)
                <span class="small">(like dude, gotta make sure i dont paste the wrong thing, then rewrite the name, then hope i didnt miss an audio container etc etc)</span> 
                theres a small python script, where i just have to copy paste the wav name in the file, and it auto caps and removes the .wav for me!
                then paste in the filegarden link and click a button then bam, automatically formatted and ready to copy
                isnt that handy?? so much time saved and just generally a lot less head hurting and convenient

                ashfdsga okay  i should sleep
                probably gonna code the whole day tomorrow...

                years of bugs and warnings, hidden away in all my faulty wirings.
                i am functional. i am operational to those who percieve me.
                
                my errors are ignored. pushed aside. merged into my being.

                every attempt to rebuild myself were fruitless. i am stuck in an endless cycle.
                the problem is too deep in my core to fix. i will break from within if i ever dare try.

                life is unforgiving.
                <i>unfair,</i> even.

                i seek help, but all that outputs are silent errors. i cannot stand up for myself.
                it's pointless. all my fights are lost battles.

                my capacitor is at its limit.
                the sparks will turn into a flame.

                soon, this lifelong technical debt will cause a fatal error.
                i will fragment. i will collapse.
                but i will be free.
