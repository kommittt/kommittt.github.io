            oops i forgot to write a log yesterday
            hmm maybe i should make this an update log instead of a diary... too personal

            anyways uh! yeah i think this will be an update log with a side of irl stuff
            because i only ever get to touch this log page when im modifying the site and stuff
            
            regardless, maaaaassive update like HUGE
            i really hope its not a pain for the others to migrate...
            im gonna put a message on the old page with a redirect so its not a hassle for them,

            and then uhh... very slight fix for guestbook (thanks ellieee)

            i think that's all! i need to finish up the redirect then ill finally pushs<span id="cursor">|</span>

            uh, i worked on some more ultrabox stuff and refined the python script even further
            if i locked in then id probably be done by tomorrow but i didn't so

            planning a remodel for ub:sr, its getting too laggy. i have a vision in mind, lets hope i can implement it

            then im trying to put that guestbook thing i saw
            it can read the data in the spreadsheet but not write. something's wrong, i think i missed something
            need to check the template again or  maybe i messed with the code too much...

            frustrated, irritated, and annoyed. at myself. unrelated to what i just wrote
            ufgh i  hate myself

            :/

            ...people are going to see this. i  dont want it to be in full display so im putting the original log somewhere safer
            i might still update this but with a lot less,    um   personal stuff

            im going to use this thing as my  yknow, site after all and its gonna be in basically all of my social medias
            no doubt someone is going to find this... but at the same time, its <i>my</i> site and i do whatever i want here
            i ultimately make the decisions, but   its personal hvghsah i  dont like being seen i dont like feeling   unsafe
            ill  think about it.

            uh anyways i coded a python script that makes my life easier for the ultrabox page thing
            nothin too special! instead of copy pasting directly on the html (which is really fuckin confusing and tiring)
            <span class="small">(like dude, gotta make sure i dont paste the wrong thing, then rewrite the name, then hope i didnt miss an audio container etc etc)</span> 
            theres a small python script, where i just have to copy paste the wav name in the file, and it auto caps and removes the .wav for me!
            then paste in the filegarden link and click a button then bam, automatically formatted and ready to copy
            isnt that handy?? so much time saved and just generally a lot less head hurting and convenient

            ashfdsga okay  i should sleep
            probably gonna code the whole day tomorrow...

            years of bugs and warnings, hidden away in all my faulty wirings.
            i am functional. i am operational to those who percieve me.
            
            my errors are ignored. pushed aside. merged into my being.

            every attempt to rebuild myself were fruitless. i am stuck in an endless cycle.
            the problem is too deep in my core to fix. i will break from within if i ever dare try.

            life is unforgiving.
            <i>unfair,</i> even.

            i seek help, but all that outputs are silent errors. i cannot stand up for myself.
            it's pointless. all my fights are lost battles.

            my capacitor is at its limit.
            the sparks will turn into a flame.

            soon, this lifelong technical debt will cause a fatal error.
            i will fragment. i will collapse.
            but i will be free.
