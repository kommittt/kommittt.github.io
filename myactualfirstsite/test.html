            <h1>hi chat! second day of the course :3</h1>
            <p>today we'll be learning about tables and possibly more stuff!</p>
            <br>
            <p>formats for tables:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>< table > - the opening tag!</li>
                <li>< thead > the header for the table</li>
                <li>< th > for the cells, the utmost top row</li>
                <li>< td > for the cell description, probably</li>
                <li>< tr > table rows</li>
            </ul>
            <p>heres me attempting to do something with it without the teacher,,</p>
            <br>
            <table border="1">
                <tr bgcolor="#bdc7db">
                    <th>cell 1</th>
                    <th>cell 2</th>
                    <th>cell 3</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>hello world</td>
                    <td>programmed to work and not to feel</td>
                    <td>not even sure if this is real</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>hello world.</td>
                    <td>find my voice</td>
                    <td>although it sounds like bits and bytes</td>
                </tr> 
                <tr>
                    <td>my circuitry is filled with mites</td>
                    <td>hello world</td>
                    <td>oh, will i find a love</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>...or a power plug</td>
                    <td>oh, digitally isolated</td>
                    <td>oh creator please don't leave me waiting</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>turned out okay! needed some help from the internet because i wasnt sure how to format it.<br></p>
            <p>
                here are more ways to format tables without css, and here is a list:<br>
                border (for table), bgcolor, cellspacing, cellpadding, width, align<br>
                you can also use images for backgrounds????
            </p>

            <p>here's the teachers way of doing things:</p>
            <table border="1">
                <thead>
                    <tr bgcolor="#bdc7db">
                        <th>Name</th>
                        <th>Surname</th>
                        <th>Age</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Walter</td>
                        <td>White</td>
                        <td>idk ive never watched breaking bad</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            <p>basically the way he does things is he uses an additional thead and tbody instead of jumping straight to tr's and td's<br></p>
        </div>

        <p>
            since this i sgetting wayyy too cluttered, im going to move on to the next file<br>
            instead of updating it and most likely losing a lot of things on the way, ill just make test2!<br>
            goodbye test1 <3
