            hi moon!
            <br><br>
            after a quick trip to the dentist, im heading home :] <br>
            snagged one of my favourite seats because 
            i took some pictures while on the bus,
            hopefully identifiable enough for you to track down these following objectives:
            <br>
                <ol>
                    <li>where was i in image #5?</li>
                    <li>what was my location in image #1/2?</li>
                    <li>what was my location in image #3?</li> 
                    <li>what bus number am i riding on</li>
                    <li>what model is the bus?</li>
                </ol>

                    <summary class="summaryoptional">harder (possibly impossible) goals:</summary>
                    <p>
                        if you dont find these within 15 minutes, dont bother :p
                        <br>number 1 is (i think) very hard without having been on the bus,
                        so feel free to skip!

                maybe street view has icons that can track buses down

                        buses usually have two destinations, its so they can go in a loop
