            hi moon!
            <br><br>
            after a quick trip to the dentist, im heading home :] <br>
            snagged one of my favourite seats because 
            i took some pictures while on the bus,
            hopefully identifiable enough for you to track down these following objectives:
            <br>
                <ol>
                    <li>where was i in image #5?</li>
                    <li>what was my location in image #1/2?</li>
                    <li>what was my location in image #3?</li> 
                    <li>what bus number am i riding on?</li>
                    <li>what model is the bus?</li>
                </ol>
