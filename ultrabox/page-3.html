        <p>hello! i am a redirector :]

            the site has gone through major changes, and this page has been replaced!
            <span class="small">thought id make a note using this old address so people wont think its gone... again</span>

            <b>please use <a href="/ultrabox/index.html">https://kommittt.github.io/ultrabox</a> instead!</b>
            its now an index instead of a <span class="small">very long and slow</span>page 1

            i did this because the old layout was <i>very</i> unmaintainable and the sounds were barely loading :/
            hopefully this new style is more comprehensible and just generally easier to use! certainly is for me lol

            anyways, you'll be redirected in about five seconds, see you there
