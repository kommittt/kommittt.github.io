        y'know, this should've been the first, but nah

        i quite like the whole command prompt vibe though
        fits the whole android thing... since, i'm supposed to be one
        <span class="small">i wonder if people are aware of that fact about my sona</span>

        and hi anyone who sees this! congrats on being one of the first, and most likely the only ones who will ever
        recognise the existence of this thing.

        by the way, no, sunny, br does not mean brazil in this case.
        and no, aster, fuck you, you can't copystrike me

        i've been thinking about something like... making a discord bot that will connect whatever i type there and send it
        to this website, but github doesn't allow server side stuff.
        there's also the problem of keeping the bot online - don't think there's any providers that will willingly give up
        their machines for this stupid ass fucking idea.
        coding it will be a hassle too.

        on a slightly related note, i've been looking into cloudflare recently. it can apparently link your gh pages site to it,
        but it'll still be hosted on github, just with a different dns. like what happened to vercel, really...
        i should work on removing that integration

        anyways, cloudflare! i think it can do server-side requests, unlike github. maybe i can do some stupid shit like that
        strawpage question thing... or the guestbook from that one site. could be cool, but as always, problem's me

        i should fix the mobile view of this, if it's even broken. most likely is!

        should be enough for the first session here, don't want it to be too depressing from the start
        ... though, there's a bunch of shit i'm very worried about right now, so i expect i'll give in a few days from now
